The Mutual Knowledge Software Development Assessment
Jun 1- 4, 2021

Hello NFT-DAO Community,

As we’ve had some turnover with development folks, some asked to be informed on the
coming and going of individuals within the community. As this is an open source project, please
understand contributors are always free to come and go on their own terms. People may
contribute or simply observe. I’ll add some back-story and jump into the assessment we
commissioned on development.

From the beginning building the Comprehensive NFT Framework in a collaborative manner was
simply suggesting that 42 Fund-3 proposers of different NFT solutions work together to build
one ‘comprehensive’ version as an open source project. Initially, I wrote the proposal with the
simple idea we should work together. I had no thoughts of a DAO structure initially. That only
occurred when Tyler and Troy joined the effort and those suggestions were added into the final
Fund-3 proposal. I believe it is a good long-term solution to form a DAO to steward the
Comprehensive NFT Framework we code-named BOXCAR. However, in the Genesis document,
it was made clear our first priority is to deliver the BOXCAR Framework.

We organized with a lead over each core function: Marketing—Tyler Wailes, Governance—Troy
Egan and Development—Michael Yagi. Each lead has had autonomy to experiment and build
their holon and teams. Which they did, and held team meetings to progress our goals. This is
new and experimental and each will attest much learning occurred both personally and
organizationally.

**Software Development**
In the early days, we had a few developers contributing ideas. No one really stepping up to
build a product and we were prepared to hire a contractor to develop the solution, until
Michael Yagi came into the picture and assumed the Lead over a developer holon. Michael
recruited his team from community folks who were showing some interest, and who also had
several Catalyst proposals of their own. As he was building his team, he had several
contributors coming and going at various times. Things settled with a few core devs who the
MuKn report mentions. Michael and I had several conversations about making sure the devs
are committed to building an open source project before they started because we had the
option of contracting the work to be done. We moved forward with the community team and
schedule to build.

Along that timeline we suggested the Gov holon figure a way to provide a Contribution token to
recognize everyone’s work. A Governance token would be too far out.

As the fund-3 proposal states, we were seeking ways to commercialize our work to have a long-
term sustainable DAO. A few devs felt they needed some assurances they would be
remunerated for their contributions and the code was being held in a private repo only theyhad access to. We offered the devs ADA equal to their time at USD120,000/yr. which they
refused as they believed the monetary value of their code in equity or Gov tokens would be
greater. However, we were not in a position yet to offer equity or Gov tokens as those aren’t
formulated. Ultimately 3 of the devs decided to finish up the MVP Ticket Sale app and depart to
work on their own projects.

Taylor Yoon, Quinn Parkinson and Dmitri Safine completed their work, transferred the code to
our open source repo under Apache License 2.0 as agreed and left the project. Michael Yagi
recently chose to no longer lead the dev holon, while remaining a contributor.

This report from MuKn was commissioned to get clear view of what the finished work the devs
left would require in order to run the Ticket Sale app.

Please read the [MuKn report](https://github.com/NFT-DAO/Akkadia/blob/main/NFT-DAO_Akkadia_Ticket_Sales_Audit_Report.pdf) for the finer details. The Ticket Sale app is not operable in the
final state it was left. It is MuKn’s opinion we are better off starting over for all the reasons they
outline.

We are excited to be working with MuKn and some other professionals moving the project
forward using contractors as was the initial plan. MuKn will provide their expertise and
extended dev relationships to meet the requirements.

Warm Regards,
Rich Kopcho
